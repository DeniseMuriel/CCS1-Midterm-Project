           Hey there! I'm Denise and a first year Computer Science student. My first encounter with a computer was when I was 9 years old. Technology wasn't as advanced as it is today and it was common to get viruses from websites, cd's, and usb sticks. Youtube was at it's earliest stage and sites were ad free. My first coding experience was during my high school days which was also html. I was always excited when it's lab day where we go to the computer lab and learn simple codes and software. These early experiences sparked my curiosity, leading me to pursue a career in technology.
