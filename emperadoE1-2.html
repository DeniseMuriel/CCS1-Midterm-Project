	<h2 style="background-color:#CCFFFF;  color:#033E3E; font-family:'Courier New', monospace; font-size:30px;"> About Myself </h2>
	<p> I'm born and raised in the city of gentle people. 
	During my free time, I do hobbies that interest me. <br>
	A few hobbies I have are painting, hiking, and crafting. 
	I love the outdoors but also love staying at home. <br>
	I'm passionate about mental health and learning.
	Moreover, I like to volunteer in causes that mean so much to me. </p>
	
	<p> I have a lot of goals and things I want to do in my life. <br>
	However, I've learned that it's also important to live in the present moment  <br>
	and not get too caught up in the future. I've come to love technology.  <br>
	I enrolled in CCS because I'm interested in the various feilds that it offers. <br>
	I just believe that there is so much to learn.
